A simple Processing (Python) project that brings Van Gogh’s *Starry Night* to life with flowing, brushstroke animations.

- show the coordinates of where the mouseclick hit on terminal and if need to print those coordinates just press P to have a full list.

## How to Run

2. Place your image file `starryNight.jpg` in the same folder as the sketch  
3. Run the code and enjoy the animated painting!

## Files
- starry.pyde: version where users could do from scratch where they want the motion to take place in the picture
